# Custom AXI4-Lite Peripheral Design using Zynq-7000

## Objective
Design a custom AXI4-Lite peripheral and integrate it with the Zynq Processing System.

## Tools Used
- Vivado Design Suite
- Verilog HDL
- Zynq-7000 SoC

## Hardware Description
A custom AXI4-Lite peripheral was created using Vivado IP Packager to control onboard LEDs.

The processor writes data to AXI registers which drive LED outputs.

## Key Concepts
- AXI4-Lite Protocol
- Memory Mapped IO
- PS-PL Communication
- Hardware-Software Co-Design

## Results
- Custom IP successfully integrated
- Bitstream generated
- Timing constraints satisfied
